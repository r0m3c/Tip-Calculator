A Tip Calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Leandro Gamarra

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] App Logo
- [x] App Splash Screen Logo

## Notes

As to any challenges that I faced in building this app, although I have taken the Intro to App Development class provided by CodePath, I still had trouble understanding all the functions and UI used in this pre-work. Specifically, I've never played around with Segmented Controls so that was very fun and challenging trying to navigate how it functions. The most challenging part was probably the optional features. I took a lot of time trying to try to implement them but I just couldn't get them to work. Much of the optional parts were new to me so I had to do some research and try to learn as I go, yet that proved to be too difficult for me. In short, this project had many obstacles that I had to overcome, some I did, others I didn't, but you learn from your mistakes. This will definitely not be the last time that I touch this app. I know I can do so much more with it.

In terms of the pros that I got out of this project, I now have my very own Tip Calculator on my phone, which I can use at any time. Moreover, this project has pushed me to read a 960 page Swift textbook on learning all there is to know about Swift. I am up to Chapter 3.5 thus far and I am enjoying it very much. It has just motivated more to build IOS apps. Lastly, I know I have learned many new things that I can use in future apps and I can always come back and update my Tip Calculator App as I learn more about Swift. Thank you for this opportunity.
